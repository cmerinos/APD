\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric data frame or matrix with items in columns.
Only complete cases are used automatically.}

\item{method}{Type of correlation: \code{"pearson"} (default) or
\code{"spearman"}.}

\item{nd}{Number of digits for rounding. Default is 3.}

\item{ci}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, bootstrap confidence intervals are computed.}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap replications. Default is 1000.}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for the interval. Default is 0.95.}

\item{method.ci}{Type of bootstrap interval: \code{"perc"} (percentile),
\code{"bca"} (bias-corrected and accelerated), or \code{"norm"}.}

\item{group}{Optional vector indicating group membership (same length as
\code{nrow(data)}). If supplied, RMSIIC is computed separately for each
group and pairwise differences are compared using MOVER intervals.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
  \item \code{group_results}: A data frame with one row per group (or a single
        row for the total sample), containing:
        \itemize{
          \item \code{group}: Group label.
          \item \code{n.items}: Number of items.
          \item \code{rms.iic}: RMSIIC estimate.
          \item \code{lwr.ci}, \code{upr.ci}: Bootstrap confidence limits
                (if \code{ci=TRUE}).
        }
  \item \code{comparisons}: A data frame with MOVER-based pairwise group
        comparisons:
        \itemize{
          \item \code{group1}, \code{group2}: Groups being compared.
          \item \code{diff}: Difference in RMSIIC (group1 - group2).
          \item \code{lwr.ci}, \code{upr.ci}: MOVER confidence limits.

\description{
Computes the root-mean-square inter-item correlation (RMSIIC), introduced by
Meyer (1975) as a measure of the average inter-item association based on the
squared correlation matrix. The function can also compute group-specific
estimates and pairwise group comparisons using the MOVER method.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{R} be the \eqn{p \times p} correlation matrix of a set of items.
Meyer (1975) defined the root-mean-square inter-item correlation as:

\deqn{
  \mathrm{RMSIIC} =
  \sqrt{
    \frac{
      \mathrm{tr}(R^{2}) - p
    }{
      p(p - 1)
    }
  } ,
}

where \eqn{\mathrm{tr}(R^{2})} denotes the trace of the squared correlation
matrix. This equals the square root of the average squared inter-item
correlation, excluding the diagonal.

Meyer argued that RMSIIC is preferable to the simple mean correlation because:
\itemize{
  \item it treats negative correlations as positive contributions (via
        squaring), avoiding sign cancellation,
  \item it gives proportionally more weight to strong correlations,
  \item it reflects overall item homogeneity more sensitively.
}

When \code{group} is supplied, the statistic is computed independently within
each group. Differences between groups are evaluated using the MOVER method,
combining group-specific confidence intervals into an interval for the
difference without assuming asymptotic normality.

Bootstrap confidence intervals may be computed using percentile, BCa, or
normal-based methods.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(200), ncol = 5)

# Single-sample RMSIIC
rmsiic(X)

# Bootstrap CI
rmsiic(X, ci = TRUE, B = 500)

# Group comparison using MOVER
g <- rep(c("A","B"), each = 20)
rmsiic(X[1:40, ], group = g, ci = TRUE, B = 300)
