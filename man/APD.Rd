\title{Average Proportional Distance (APD)}
\usage{
APD(data, ncat, ci, conf.level, B, cimethod)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} or matrix containing item responses. Each
column represents an item scored on the same categorical scale.}

\item{ncat}{Integer. Number of response categories for the items (e.g., 5 for a 1–5 scale).
Used to convert the average difference into the proportional metric.}

\item{ci}{Logical. Should a bootstrap confidence interval for APD be computed?}

\item{conf.level}{Numeric (0–1). Confidence level (e.g., \code{0.95}) when \code{ci = TRUE}.}

\item{B}{Integer. Number of bootstrap resamples used when computing CIs.}

\item{cimethod}{Character. Type of confidence interval: \code{"bca"}, \code{"perc"}, or \code{"norm"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the following rows:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"Av. diff."}: the average absolute difference \code{AD}.
  \item \code{"Av. Prop Diff."}: the proportional difference \code{APD}.
  \item \code{"Low CI"}: bootstrap lower confidence bound (if \code{ci = TRUE}).
  \item \code{"Upper CI"}: bootstrap upper confidence bound (if \code{ci = TRUE}).
}
}
\description{
Average Proportional Distance (APD) is a measure of a test's internal
consistency that focuses on the average difference between item scores.
To calculate it, you find the absolute difference between every pair of
item scores, average those differences, and then divide by the number of
response options (minus one) to get a proportional score, which ranges
from 0 to 1.
}
\details{
The APD is computed in three main steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Compute the absolute difference between every possible pair of item
  scores for each respondent.
  \item Average all absolute differences across respondents and item pairs to
  obtain the average difference \code{AD}.
  \item Divide \code{AD} by \code{ncat - 1} to rescale it to the
  proportional metric:
  \deqn{APD = AD / (n_{\mathrm{cat}} - 1).}
}

The APD ranges from 0 (perfect internal consistency) to 1 (maximum possible
inconsistency given the response scale). Lower values reflect greater similarity
among item scores, indicating stronger internal consistency.

When \code{ci = TRUE}, APD confidence intervals are obtained by nonparametric
bootstrap resampling. Three interval types are available:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"bca"} — bias-corrected and accelerated interval.
  \item \code{"perc"} — percentile interval.
  \item \code{"norm"} — normal-approximation interval.
}
}
\section{Interpretation}{

APD quantifies the *average disagreement* between item scores on a 0–1 scale.
The following informal guidelines may help interpretation:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{APD < 0.20}: typically indicates very good internal consistency.
  \item \strong{0.20 ≤ APD ≤ 0.25}: often acceptable depending on the construct.
  \item \strong{APD > 0.25}: may signal weaker internal consistency or heterogeneous item content.
}
These values are not strict cutoffs and should be interpreted alongside other
reliability evidence (e.g., alpha, omega) and substantive test characteristics.

\examples{
\donttest{
set.seed(123)
x <- data.frame(matrix(sample(1:5, 200 * 5, replace = TRUE), ncol = 5))

# APD without confidence interval
APD(x, ncat = 5, ci = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95, B = 500, cimethod = "perc")

# APD with 95\% percentile CI
APD(x, ncat = 5, ci = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95, B = 300, cimethod = "perc")

# APD with BCa CI
APD(x, ncat = 5, ci = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95, B = 300, cimethod = "bca")
}
